## Our Results
<p>
 To give you an idea just how extreme the dimension of the data surrounding conditions is we produced a matrix of correlation that to even trained eyes, the visual is strikingly confusing. Because nothing about these individual nuggets is directly informative unless compared against the things that were missing in from comparison individually also.<br>

 To implement modeling we construvted an algorithm to evaluate
 hyper parameters using Jaccard Score, 
 Jaccard Index, and the accuracy of the model with normalized data, and a split for the training and testing sets of 90% and 10% of the data respectively. <br>
 
| Accuracy  | K-Neighbors | Score              |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------|
| Train Set | 8           | 0.7897386253630203 |
| Test Set  | 8           | 0.7665505226480837 |
