## Our Conclusion
<p>
 I belive the data and our results make a case that one can indeed inform travel decisions with some knowledge of the potential for causes that underly every day situations. It is not useful as a stand-alone tool. It would in our opinion, make an exceptionally helpful aside to existing products and technologies. It has the potential for identifying anomolies if one were to add real time traffic data to any assesment of conditions. Maybe a road crew is brought in early for safety. Maybe a mother takes the road less traveled and avoids the danger zones at dangerous times, because most of their travel is local.

 It would be most useful as a non time based "when" component of an avoidance scenario comprised also of, "why" and "where" in real-time. This would be useful, because at present, if it's rush hour, most of us avoid it. When it isn't we don't assume any real time-cost savings, nor potential for grave harm in our route selection. An individual is far less likely to apply this knowledge cognitively if weighed strictly on a time-to-destination basis. If it informed a route selection algorithm for navigation, it would be a silent enforcer of good common sense.
