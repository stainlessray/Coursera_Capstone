## About the Data
<p>
     The dataset used contains approximately 3.5 million accident records in the contiguous 49 US States. All listings for the state of Delaware were isolated for use in modeling and acquiring insight specific to the State. The dataset incorporates a diverse featureset, and aggregates several individual features from the data into an accident severity scale of 1-4 (Least to most severe). The isolated dataset contained 5,739 accident records. It contains 49 Feature columns including 2 sets of geographic coordinates (start/stop), addresses, road names, zip codes, traffic results as described in official reports, and 27 different weather conditions. There is good reason for confidence in the veracity of the dataset for the use we intend to make.<br>

 Exploring the data bubbled up some surprises very early on. Of course we can help if we know the road is slippery right? Wrong. At least not in this state. The overwhelming majority of accidents of all severities occur during clear skies. Snow and ice donâ€™t even make the top ten list. Who knew?<br>
