# Predicting Severe Traffic Disruption For Use in Preventing Traffic Disruption


## Introduction
### “Can we predict the potential for  severe accidents, and use the information to aid in solving the problem of severe accidents?”

<p>
    The state of Delaware faces numerous unique demographic challenges with regard to public safety on state, and interstate roadways. Most of those challenges fall under the mandate of the Delaware Division of Transportation, or DELDoT. DELDoT provides numerous resources that seek to inform Delaware drivers on road conditions, construction projects, hazardous situations, and promote overall safety on the roads and highways of the first state. However, they are not a target or sponsor of the study in any way. The study is not affiliated with any government or corporate entity. The target of the study is the public at large. Helping local drivers remain informed, and become more knowledgeable in real-time has the potential to save lives, and money for every user of vital public roadways. <br>
    
 The machine learning component will attempt to determine the viability of predicting which categories of “severity” are most likely at any given time using live data, and present possible sources of live data to accomplish that goal. <br>
