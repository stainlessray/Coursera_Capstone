#### Accuracy and potential 
 
 The resulting accuracy scores may not seem very high, but they are very persistent when random sampling is used, as well as when we use the entire dataset. If one were to build a deep learning model with this data, it would be best to incorporate at least one additional factor. The conditions data remains a balanced but sparse evaluator that in theory would not be responsive enough to small changes, even in the few features we deemed to be most important. The model as is would likely be underfit slightly most of the time, and overfit when conditions are in transition. It remains plausible that reducing the conditions to a small number of categories, the fit would tighten to real conditions changes.<br> 

#### Straight talk

 Prediction of a severe accident event would require knowledge of the future. Predicting good times to avoid particular locales could be extremely useful to ambulance, fire, police, and especially the general population as a feature in navigation tools we all depend on almost every day. For example, if a navigation provider wanted to use traffic and conditions as weights to route recommendations. One can assume similar is being done or would be sought if AI modeling work were taken up on these theories and results.<br>

#### The human concerns

We believe it is imperative to remember when we look at a large dataset of this nature that there is suffering in the numbers. The last three years have displayed potential for exponential growth of accident count with local officials attempting to acertain why. To Delawareans, and our friends and family in neighboring states, <em>please</em> be mindful. According to <a href="https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/2020/03/03/delaware-track-see-more-car-crash-deaths-2020-than-2019/4934162002/">Delaware Online</a> traffic accidents, traffic fatalaties, and pedestrian fatalities due to automobile accidents are all rising in 2020. And while the majority of money and disruption is inherent to the pupulous north's congestion, the fatalaties are coming from the center of the state, in Kent County. This disproportion is worthy of note. <a href="https://deldot.gov/Publications/manuals/traffic_counts/index.shtml">Traffic counts</a> and  seasonal factors are a couple obvious possibilities. There could be more underneath it all.<br>
