## Our Results
<p>
 To implement modeling we construvted an algorithm to evaluate
 hyper parameters using Jaccard Score, 
 Jaccard Index, and the accuracy of the model with normalized data, and a split for the training and testing sets of 90% and 10% of the data respectively. <br>
 
| Accuracy  | K-Neighbors | Score              |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------|
| Train Set | 8           | 0.79               |
| Test Set  | 8           | 0.77               |
|           |             |                    |<br>

| Jaccard | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Score   | 0.61   |
| Index   | 0.62   |
| F1      | 0.77   |<br>

 To give you an idea just how extreme the dimension of the data surrounding conditions is we produced a matrix of correlation that to even trained eyes, the visual is strikingly confusing. Because nothing about these individual nuggets is directly informative. by itself.<br>
