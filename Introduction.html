<h1> Predicting Severe Traffic Disruption For Use in Preventing Traffic Disruption</h1>


<h2> Introduction</h2><br>
<h3><em>“Can we predict the potential for  severe accidents, and use the information to aid in solving the problem of severe accidents?”</em></h3>

     The state of Delaware faces numerous unique demographic challenges with regard to 
     public safety on state, and interstate roadways. Most of those challenges fall under 
     the mandate of the Delaware Division of Transportation, or DELDoT. DELDoT provides 
     numerous resources that seek to inform Delaware drivers on road conditions, construction
     projects, hazardous situations, and promote overall safety on the roads and highways of 
     the first state. However, they are not a target or sponsor of the study in any way. 
     The study is not affiliated with any government or corporate entity. The target of 
     the study is the public at large. Helping local drivers remain informed, and become
     more knowledgeable in real-time has the potential to save lives, and money for every 
     user of vital public roadways. <br><br>

     The machine learning component will attempt to determine the viability of predicting 
     which categories of “severity” are most likely at any given time using live data, and 
     present possible sources of live data to accomplish that goal. <br><br>
