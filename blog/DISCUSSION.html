                    The resulting accuracy scores may not seem very high, but they are very persistent 
                    when random sampling is used, as well as the entire dataset. If one were to build a 
                    Deep Learning model with this data, it would be best to incorporate at least one 
                    additional factor. The conditions data remains a balanced but sparse evaluator that 
                    in theory would not be as responsive to changes in conditions as it is with 
                    known condition patterns. The model as is would likely be underfit slightly most 
                    of the time, and overfit when conditions are in transition. It remains plausible 
                    that reducing the conditions to a small number of categories, the fit would tighten 
                    to real conditions changes.

                    Prediction of a severe accident event would require knowledge of the future. 
                    Predicting good times to avoid particular locales could be extremely useful to 
                    ambulance and fire rescue, police, and to the general population as a feature 
                    in navigation tools we all depend on reliably. For example, if a navigation 
                    provider wanted to use traffic and conditions as weights to route recommendations. 
                    One can assume similar is being done or would be sought if AI modeling work were 
                    taken up on these theories and results.

                        We believe it is imperative to remember when we look at a large dataset 
                        of this nature that there is suffering in the numbers. The last three years 
                        have displayed potential for exponential growth of accident count with 
                        local officials attempting to acertain why. To Delawareans, and our friends 
                        and family in neighboring states, please be mindful. 
                        According to 
                        <a href="https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/2020/03/03/delaware-track-see-more-car-crash-deaths-2020-than-2019/4934162002/">Delaware Online</a>
                        traffic accidents, traffic fatalaties, and pedestrian fatalities due to auto 
                        accidents are all rising in 2020. And while the majority of money and disruption is 
                        inherent to the pupulous north's congestion, the fatalaties are coming from the 
                        center of the state, in Kent County. This disproportion is worthy of note.

                        and seasonal factors are a couple obvious possibilities. There could be more underneath it all.<br><br>
