<h1> Predicting Severe Traffic Disruption For Use in Preventing Traffic Disruption</h1>


<h2>About the Data</h2><br>
<h3><em>“The overwhelming majority of accidents of the highest severity occur during clear skies.”</em></h3>

    <p>
        The dataset used contains approximately 3.5 million accident records from within the 
        contiguous 49 US States. All listings for the state of Delaware were isolated 
        for use in modeling and acquiring insight specific to the State. The dataset 
        incorporates a diverse featureset, and aggregates several individual features 
        from the data into an accident severity scale of 1-4 (Least to most severe). 
        The isolated dataset contained 5,739 accident records. It contains 49 feature 
        columns including 2 sets of geographic coordinates (start/stop), addresses, 
        road names, zip codes, traffic results as described in official reports, and
        27 different weather conditions. There is good reason for confidence in the 
        veracity of the dataset for the use we intend to make.<br> <br><br>

        Exploring the data bubbled up some surprises very early on. Of course we can assume 
        we can help if we know the road is slippery, right? Not exactly. At least not in this state. 
        The overwhelming majority of accidents of the highest severity occur during clear skies. 
        Snow and ice don’t even make the top ten list. Who knew? <br><br>
