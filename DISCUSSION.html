        <h1> Predicting Severe Traffic Disruption For Use in Preventing Traffic Disruption</h1>
        <h2> Our Thoughts</h2><br>
        <h3><em>“Prediction of a severe accident event would require knowledge of the future. 
            Predicting good times to avoid particular locales could be extremely useful to 
            ambulance and fire rescue, police, and to the general population as a feature 
            in navigation tools we all depend on reliably.”</em></h3>

                    The resulting accuracy scores may not seem very high, but they are very persistent 
                    when random sampling is used, as well as the entire dataset. If one were to build a 
                    Deep Learning model with this data, it would be best to incorporate at least one 
                    additional factor. The conditions data remains a balanced but sparse evaluator that 
                    in theory would not be responsive enough to changes in conditions as it is with 
                    known condition patterns. The model as is would likely be underfit slightly most 
                    of the time, and overfit when conditions are in transition. It remains plausible 
                    that reducing the conditions to a small number of categories, the fit would tighten 
                    to real conditions changes.

                        Prediction of a severe accident event would require knowledge of the future. 
                        Predicting good times to avoid particular locales could be extremely useful to 
                        ambulance and fire rescue, police, and to the general population as a feature 
                        in navigation tools we all depend on reliably. For example, if a navigation 
                        provider wanted to use traffic and conditions as weights to route recommendations. 
                        One can assume similar is being done or would be sought if AI modeling work were 
                        taken up on these theories and results.
