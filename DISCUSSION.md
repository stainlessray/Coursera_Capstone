 The resulting accuracy scores may not seem very high, but they are very persistent when random sampling is used, as well as the entire dataset. If one were to build a Deep Learning model with this data, it would be best to incorporate at least one additional factor. The conditions data remains a balanced but sparse evaluator that in theory would not be responsive enough to changes in conditions as it is with known condition patterns. The model as is would likely be underfit slightly most of the time, and underfit when conditions are in transition. It remains plausible that reducing the conditions to a small number of categories, the fit would tighten to real conditions changes.<br> 

 Prediction of a severe accident event would require knowledge of the future. Predicting good times to avoid particular locales could be extremely useful to ambulance and fire rescue, police, and to the general population as a feature in navigation tools we all depend on reliably. For example, if a navigation provider wanted to use traffic and conditions as weights to route recommendations. One can assume similar is being done or would be sought if AI modeling work were taken up on these theories and results.<br>
