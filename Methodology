## About the Methods
<p>
     To begin we looked at the overall distribution of accidents throughput the state. The most populous of Delaware's three counties is Newcastle. It is also a major transportation hub for interstate travel because it hosts a very important section of the I-95 corrider stretching almost the entire length of the East Coast.<br>

 The distribution of severity grades give way to some new inferences about "Conditions" as a predictor. We found that the overall dimension of the dataset is too great. So when all of those data are encoded and fit for modeling, the propensity for overfit jumps out at you. Combining a single "Specific" or non-general statistic was effective at taming the model, but nowhere near accurate enough to be useful in prediction. So we looked at it from another angle to determine if there was any corroboration for the initial take that - This data is too detailed!<br>
